You'll be safe in my romance, babe, uh
Label's fading but
I see you cravin' for more
You're denying it
But you ain't controlling your actions
Keep me guessing but
Don't keep me waiting for us

Oh, I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give
All that I wish is for you to take me
But I taste the lies on your lips
I count the days when we're in love
'Cause I only matter when he's not around
Oh, but I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give, mhm

Got my heart on my sleeve
I'm beggin' the heavens to be good to me
Are you obsessive love?
'Cause I'm tolerating all of your desires
I'll keep you wanting me more, ooh
Leave but I'll keep you comin'
I'm sure it's my love that got you suffocated

Oh, I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give
All that I wish is for you to take me
But I taste the lies on your lips
I count the days when we're in love
'Cause I only matter when he's not around
Oh, but I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give, mhm

Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Take all the love that I give
All that I

You come over but not too often
You don't visit 'cause you got more options
You come over but not too often
You don't visit 'cause you got more options

Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
